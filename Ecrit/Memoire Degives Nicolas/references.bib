The possibility to use this information as inputs of models is an opportunity to develop models that integrate new processes and genetic inputs. We assessed to what extent the phenomics and modelling communities can address the issues of interoperability and data exchange, using a science mapping approach (i.e. visualization and analysis of a broad range of scientific and technological activities as a whole). In this paper, we (i) evaluate connections, (ii) identify compatible and connectable research topics and (iii) propose strategies to facilitate connection across communities. We applied a science mapping approach based on reference and term analyses to a set of 4332 scientific papers published by the plant phenomics and modelling communities from 1980 to 2019, retrieved using the Elsevier’s Scopus database and the quantitative-plant.org website. The number of papers on phenotyping and modelling dramatically increased during the past decade, boosted by progress in phenotyping technologies and by key developments at hardware and software levels. The science mapping approach indicated a large diversity of research topics studied in each community. Despite compatibilities of research topics, the level of connection between the phenomics and modelling communities was low. Although phenomics and modelling crucially need to exchange data, the two communities appeared to be weakly connected. We encourage these communities to work on ontologies, harmonized formats, translators and connectors to facilitate transparent data exchange.},

	abstract = {Most traits associated with drought tolerance have a dual effect, positive in very severe scenarios and negative in milder scenarios, or the opposite trend. Their effects also depend on other climatic conditions such as evaporative demand or light, and on management practices. This is the case for processes associated with cell protection and with avoidance, but also for the maintenance of growth or photosynthesis, high water use efﬁciency, large root systems or reduced abortion rate under water deﬁcit. Therefore, spectacular results obtained in one drought scenario may have a limited interest for improving food security in other geographical areas with water scarcity. The most relevant questions on drought tolerance are probably, ‘Does a given allele confer a positive effect on yield in an appreciable proportion of years/scenarios in a given area or target population of environment ({TPE})?’; ‘In a given site or {TPE}, what is the trade-off between risk avoidance and maintained performance?’; and ‘Will a given allele or trait have an increasingly positive effect with climate change?’ Considerable progress has already occurred in drought tolerance. Nevertheless, explicitly associating traits for tolerance to drought scenarios may have profound consequences on the genetic strategies, with a necessary involvement of modelling.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many computational tools, such as image analysis, data management, process-based simulation, and upscaling tools, have been developed to help quantify and understand water flow in the soil–root system, at multiple scales (tissue, organ, plant, and population). Several of these tools work together or at least are compatible. However, for the uninformed researcher, they might seem disconnected, forming an unclear and disorganized succession of tools. In this article, we show how different studies can be further developed by connecting them to analyse soil–root water relations in a comprehensive and structured network. This ‘explicit network of soil–root computational tools’ informs readers about existing tools and helps them understand how their data (past and future) might fit within the network. We also demonstrate the novel possibilities of scale-consistent parameterizations made possible by the network with a set of case studies from the literature. Finally, we discuss existing gaps in the network and how we can move forward to fill them.},

This Viewpoint addresses the need for a centralized ﬁne-root trait database, and introduces the Fine-Root Ecology Database ({FRED}, http://roots.ornl.gov) which so far includes {\textgreater} 70 000 observations encompassing a broad range of root traits and also includes associated environmental data. {FRED} represents a critical step toward improving our understanding of below-ground plant ecology. For example, {FRED} facilitates the quantiﬁcation of variation in ﬁne-root traits across root orders, species, biomes, and environmental gradients while also providing a platform for assessments of covariation among root, leaf, and wood traits, the role of ﬁne roots in ecosystem functioning, and the representation of ﬁne roots in terrestrial biosphere models.

Although root traits capture key dimensions related to plant responses to changing environmental conditions and effects on ecosystem processes, they have rarely been included in large-scale comparative studies and global models.

Thus, to overcome conceptual and methodological roadblocks preventing a widespread integration of root trait data into large-scale analyses we created the Global Root Trait ({GRooT}) Database. {GRooT} provides readyto-use data by combining the expertise of root ecologists with data mobilization and curation. Specifically, we (a) determined a set of core root traits relevant to the description of plant form and function based on an assessment by experts, (b) maximized species coverage through data standardization within and among traits, and (c) implemented data quality checks.},

Currently, many methods for sectioning plant material are either low throughput or involve free-hand sectioning which requires a signiﬁcant amount of practice. Here, we present an updated method to provide rapid and high-quality cross sections, primarily of root tissue but which can also be readily applied to other tissues such as leaves or stems. To increase the throughput of traditional agarose embedding and sectioning, custom designed 3D printed molds were utilized to embed 5–15 roots in a block for sectioning in a single cut. A single ﬂuorescent stain in combination with laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to obtain high quality images of thick sections. The provided {CAD} ﬁles allow production of the embedding molds described here from a number of online 3D printing services. Although originally developed for roots, this method provides rapid, high quality cross sections of many plant tissue types, making it suitable for use in forward genetic screens for differences in speciﬁc cell structures or developmental changes. To demonstrate the utility of the technique, the two parent lines of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) Chinese Spring × Paragon doubled haploid mapping population were phenotyped for root anatomical differences. Signiﬁcant differences in adventitious cross section area, stele area, xylem, phloem, metaxylem, and cortical cell ﬁle count were found.},

	abstract = {Root hydraulic properties play a central role in the global water cycle, in agricultural systems productivity, and in ecosystem survival as they impact the canopy water supply. However, the existing experimental methods to quantify root hydraulic conductivities, such as the root pressure probing, are particularly challenging, and their applicability to thin roots and small root segments is limited. Therefore, there is a gap in methods enabling easy estimations of root hydraulic conductivities in diverse root types. Here, we present a new pipeline to quickly estimate root hydraulic conductivities across different root types, at high resolution along root axes. Shortly, free-hand root cross-sections were used to extract a selected number of key anatomical traits. We used these traits to parametrize the Generator of Root Anatomy in R ({GRANAR}) model to simulate root anatomical networks. Finally, we used these generated anatomical networks within the Model of Explicit Cross-section Hydraulic Anatomy ({MECHA}) to compute an estimation of the root axial and radial hydraulic conductivities (kx and kr, respectively). Using this combination of anatomical data and computational models, we were able to create a root hydraulic conductivity atlas at the root system level, for 14-day-old pot-grown Zea mays (maize) plants of the var. B73. The altas highlights the significant functional variations along and between different root types. For instance, predicted variations of radial conductivity along the root axis were strongly dependent on the maturation stage of hydrophobic barriers. The same was also true for the maturation rates of the metaxylem vessels. Differences in anatomical traits along and across root types generated substantial variations in radial and axial conductivities estimated with our novel approach. Our methodological pipeline combines anatomical data and computational models to turn root crosssection images into a detailed hydraulic atlas. It is an inexpensive, fast, and easily applicable investigation tool for root hydraulics that complements existing complex experimental methods. It opens the way to high-throughput studies on the functional importance of root types in plant hydraulics, especially if combined with novel phenotyping techniques such as laser ablation tomography.},

Nevertheless, it is considered an orphan crop as it lags far behind other cereals in terms of genetic improvement efforts. Breeding pearl millet varieties with improved root traits promises to deliver beneﬁts in water and nutrient acquisition. Here, we characterize early pearl millet root system development using several different root phenotyping approaches that include rhizotrons and {microCT}. We report that early stage pearl millet root system development is characterized by a fast growing primary root that quickly colonizes deeper soil horizons. We also describe root anatomical studies that revealed three distinct types of lateral roots that form on both primary roots and crown roots. Finally, we detected signiﬁcant variation for two root architectural traits, primary root lenght and lateral root density, in pearl millet inbred lines. This study provides the basis for subsequent genetic experiments to identify loci associated with interesting early root development traits in this important cereal.},

            We present in this paper a novel, semiautomated image-analysis software to streamline the quantitative analysis of root growth and architecture of complex root systems. The software combines a vectorial representation of root objects with a powerful tracing algorithm that accommodates a wide range of image sources and quality. The root system is treated as a collection of roots (possibly connected) that are individually represented as parsimonious sets of connected segments. Pixel coordinates and gray level are therefore turned into intuitive biological attributes such as segment diameter and orientation as well as distance to any other segment or topological position. As a consequence, user interaction and data analysis directly operate on biological entities (roots) and are not hampered by the spatially discrete, pixel-based nature of the original image. The software supports a sampling-based analysis of root system images, in which detailed information is collected on a limited number of roots selected by the user according to specific research requirements. The use of the software is illustrated with a time-lapse analysis of cluster root formation in lupin (Lupinus albus) and an architectural analysis of the maize (Zea mays) root system. The software, {SmartRoot}, is an operating system-independent freeware based on {ImageJ} and relies on cross-platform standards for communication with data-analysis software.},

Future crops need to be higher yielding than today, but at the same time more resilient to drought and increased temperatures, especially in drought-prone regions with erratic precipitation. Sorghum, more heat and drought tolerant than maize, presents an interesting candidate for potential genetic material to provide this increased resilience, containing traits and the underlying genetic loci conferring better performance. Compared to the above-ground tissues, root systems are less investigated, but an improvement in this “hidden half ” also improves yield. Due to their close relationship, findings in sorghum may be easily incorporated into maize breeding programs. In this chapter we will review recent literature on sorghum and other cereal root system improvements and provide unpublished data on the natural variation of sorghum root development.},

	abstract = {Wheat yields globally will depend increasingly on good management to conserve rainfall and new varieties that use water efﬁciently for grain production. Here we propose an approach for developing new varieties to make better use of deep stored water. We focus on water-limited wheat production in the summer-dominant rainfall regions of India and Australia, but the approach is generally applicable to other environments and root-based constraints. Use of stored deep water is valuable because it is more predictable than variable in-season rainfall and can be measured prior to sowing. Further, this moisture is converted into grain with twice the efﬁciently of in-season rainfall since it is taken up later in crop growth during the grain-ﬁlling period when the roots reach deeper layers. We propose that wheat varieties with a deeper root system, a redistribution of branch root density from the surface to depth, and with greater radial hydraulic conductivity at depth would have higher yields in rainfed systems where crops rely on deep water for grain ﬁll. Developing selection systems for mature root system traits is challenging as there are limited high-throughput phenotyping methods for roots in the ﬁeld, and there is a risk that traits selected in the lab on young plants will not translate into mature root system traits in the ﬁeld. We give an example of a breeding programme that combines laboratory and ﬁeld phenotyping with proof of concept evaluation of the trait at the beginning of the selection programme. This would greatly enhance conﬁdence in a high-throughput laboratory or ﬁeld screen, and avoid investment in screens without yield value. This approach requires careful selection of ﬁeld sites and years that allow expression of deep roots and increased yield. It also requires careful selection and crossing of germplasm to allow comparison of root expression among genotypes that are similar for other traits, especially ﬂowering time and disease and toxicity resistances. Such a programme with ﬁeld and laboratory evaluation at the outset will speed up delivery of varieties with improved root systems for higher yield.},

Here we ask: 1) what root phenotypes improve the water use from drying soils? and 2) what root hydraulic properties impact water flow across the soil-plant continuum? The main objective is to propose a hydraulic framework to investigate the interplay between soil and root hydraulic properties on water uptake. We collected highly resolved data on transpiration, leaf and soil water potential across 11 crops and 10 contrasting soil textures. In drying soils, the drop in water potential at the soil-root interface resulted in a rapid decrease in soil hydraulic conductance, especially at higher transpiration rates. The analysis reveals that water uptake was limited by soil within a wide range of soil water potential (-6 to -1000 {kPa}), depending on both soil textures and root hydraulic phenotypes. We propose that a root phenotype with low root hydraulic conductance, long roots, and/or long and dense root hairs postpones soil limitation in drying soils. The consequence of these root phenotypes on crop water use is discussed.},

Methods and Results  Müllers et al. (2022) used Magnetic Resonance Imaging in combination with the Soil Water Profiler to demonstrate that the assumption of a constant root water uptake rate by root length across the root system leads to erroneous assumptions of root system water uptake in the soil profile.
Conclusion  Historically, this finding may not come as a surprise but it explicitly addresses this issue for intact root systems of several species. Future research efforts may be directed in combining root system imaging with biophysical and anatomical analyses to further advance our understanding of root system hydraulics in relation to soil water depletion.},

            One of roots’ key roles is to secure access to water and nutrients for the plant, often in a highly heterogeneous and challenging environment. To cope with such function, root systems have evolved as highly plastic, responsive and diverse organs. However, due to technical constraints, root research has long been stuck in its infancy. This teaching tool discusses the relatively young field of root system architecture quantification. It introduces the concepts of phenes (like genes, but referring to the phenotype), and architectural concepts including morphology, geometry, and topology. It concludes by discussing the practical considerations linked to the root system architecture quantification (including growth and sampling methods), and different data analysis methods.

	abstract = {Background:  In order to maintain high yields while saving water and preserving non-renewable resources and thus limiting the use of chemical fertilizer, it is crucial to select plants with more efficient root systems. This could be achieved through an optimization of both root architecture and root uptake ability and/or through the improvement of positive plant interactions with microorganisms in the rhizosphere. The development of devices suitable for highthroughput phenotyping of root structures remains a major bottleneck.
Results:  Rhizotrons suitable for plant growth in controlled conditions and non-invasive image acquisition of plant shoot and root systems ({RhizoTubes}) are described. These {RhizoTubes} allow growing one to six plants simultaneously, having a maximum height of 1.1 m, up to 8 weeks, depending on plant species. Both shoot and root compartment can be imaged automatically and non-destructively throughout the experiment thanks to an imaging cabin (Rhizo‑Cab). {RhizoCab} contains robots and imaging equipment for obtaining high-resolution pictures of plant roots. Using this versatile experimental setup, we illustrate how some morphometric root traits can be determined for various species including model (Medicago truncatula), crops (Pisum sativum, Brassica napus, Vitis vinifera, Triticum aestivum) and weed (Vulpia myuros) species grown under non-limiting conditions or submitted to various abiotic and biotic constraints. The measurement of the root phenotypic traits using this system was compared to that obtained using “classic” growth conditions in pots.
Conclusions:  This integrated system, to include 1200 Rhizotubes, will allow high-throughput phenotyping of plant shoots and roots under various abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Our system allows an easy visualization or extraction of roots and measurement of root traits for high-throughput or kinetic analyses. The utility of this system for studying root system architecture will greatly facilitate the identification of genetic and environmental determi‑nants of key root traits involved in crop responses to stresses, including interactions with soil microorganisms.},

	abstract = {Most plant breeding is based on “defect elimination” or “selection for yield”. A valuable additional approach is available through the breeding of crop ideotypes, plants with model characteristics known to influence photosynthesis, growth and (in cereals) grain production. Some instances of the successful use of model characters of this kind are quoted. It is postulated that a successful crop ideotype will be a weak competitor, relative to its mass. Thus the like plants in the crop community will compete with each other to a minimum degree. This relationship of plant form to the exploitation of the enviroment may lead to two negative relationships among genotypes, namely : (a) Between the performance of cultivars at low density and at high density respectively, and (b) Between the competitive ability of cultivars against other genotypes on the one hand, and their capacity for yield in pure culture on the other. A crop ideotype will make a minimum demand on resources per unit of dry matter produced. Further, in cereals, each unit of dry matter will include such a number of florets as to ensure that the ear has sufficient capacity to accept all photosynthates either from its own green surfaces or from other parts of the plant. These criteria are to be satisfied especially at high fertility, and when the total pressure by the community on environmental resources is intensified by high density of population. A wheat ideotype is described. It has a short, strong stem; few, small, erect leaves; a large ear (this specifically means many florets per unit of dry matter of the tops); an erect ear; awns; and a single culm. The design of crop ideotypes is likely to involve concurrent modifications of the environment. The wheat ideotype here described will call for consideration of the density of planting, the fertilizer rate, the plant arrangement and weed control.},

	abstract = {Hydrotropism is the movement or growth of a plant towards water. It is a type of tropism, or directional growth response, that is triggered by water. Plants are able to detect water through various stimuli, including changes in moisture levels and changes in water potential. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of how root movement towards water and plant water uptake are stabilized. The impact of hydrotropism on plants can be signiﬁcant. It can help plants to survive in environments where water is scarce, and it can also help them to grow more efﬁciently by directing their roots towards the most nutrient-rich soil. To make sure that plant growth and water uptake are stabilized, plants must sense water. Flowing down the roots, being absorbed by roots, and evaporating from the leaves are all processes that are governed by plant physiology and soil science. Soil texture and moisture affect water uptake. Hydraulic resistances can impede plants’ water absorption, while loss of water and water movement can change plants’ water potential gradients. Growth causes water potential gradients. Plants respond to gradient changes. Stomata and aquaporins govern water ﬂow and loss. When water is scarce, stomatal closure and hydraulic conductance adjustments prevent water loss. Plants adapt to water stream changes by expanding their roots towards water and reﬁning the architecture of their roots. Our study indicates that water availability, or gradients, are impacted by systemic and local changes in water availability. The amount of water available is reﬂected in plant turgor. There is still a lot of work to be done regarding the study of how the loss and availability of water affect plant cells, as well as how biophysical signals are transformed in a certain way during their transmission into chemical signals so that pathways such as abscisic acid response or organ development can be fed with information.},

	abstract = {Root elongation in drying soil is generally limited by a combination of mechanical impedance and water stress. Relationships between root elongation rate, water stress (matric potential), and mechanical impedance (penetration resistance) are reviewed, detailing the interactions between these closely related stresses. Root elongation is typically halved in repacked soils with penetrometer resistances {\textgreater}0.8–2 {MPa}, in the absence of water stress. Root elongation is halved by matric potentials drier than about –0.5 {MPa} in the absence of mechanical impedance. The likelihood of each stress limiting root elongation is discussed in relation to the soil strength characteristics of arable soils. A survey of 19 soils, with textures ranging from loamy sand to silty clay loam, found that ;10\% of penetration resistances were {\textgreater}2 {MPa} at a matric potential of –10 {kPa}, rising to nearly 50\% {\textgreater}2 {MPa} at – 200 {kPa}. This suggests that mechanical impedance is often a major limitation to root elongation in these soils even under moderately wet conditions, and is important to consider in breeding programmes for drought-resistant crops. Root tip traits that may improve root penetration are considered with respect to overcoming the external (soil) and internal (cell wall) pressures resisting elongation. The potential role of root hairs in mechanically anchoring root tips is considered theoretically, and is judged particularly relevant to roots growing in biopores or from a loose seed bed into a compacted layer of soil.},

Anatomical phenes that reduce the metabolic cost of the root cortex (‘cortical burden’) improve soil exploration and therefore water acquisition from drying soil. The best evidence for this is for root cortical aerenchyma; cortical cell file number and cortical senescence may also be useful in this context. Variation in the number and diameter of xylem vessels strongly affects axial water conductance. Reduced axial conductance may be useful in conserving soil water so that a crop may complete its life cycle under terminal drought. Variation in the suberization and lignification of the endodermis and exodermis affects radial water conductance, and may therefore be important in reducing water loss from mature roots into dry soil. Rhizosheaths may protect the water status of young root tissue. Root hairs and larger diameter root tips improve root penetration of hard, drying soil. Many of these phenes show substantial genotypic variation. The utility of these phenes for water acquisition has only rarely been validated, and may have strong interactions with the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water availability, and with root architecture and other aspects of the root phenotype. This complexity calls for structural–functional plant modelling and 3D imaging methods. Root anatomical phenes represent a promising yet underexplored and untapped source of crop breeding targets.},

            We report physiological and anatomical characteristics of water transport across roots grown in soil of two cultivars of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) differing in response to water stress (Grenache, isohydric; Chardonnay, anisohydric). Both cultivars have similar root hydraulic conductances (L  o; normalized to root dry weight) that change diurnally. There is a positive correlation between L  o and transpiration. Under water stress, both cultivars have reduced minimum daily L  o (predawn) attributed to the development of apoplastic barriers. Water-stressed and well-watered Chardonnay had the same diurnal change in amplitude of L  o, while water-stressed Grenache showed a reduction in daily amplitude compared with well-watered plants. Hydraulic conductivity of root cortex cells (L  pcell) doubles in Chardonnay but remains unchanged in Grenache. Of the two most highly expressed plasma membrane intrinsic protein ({PIP}) aquaporins in roots ({VvPIP}1;1 and {VvPIP}2;2), only {VvPIP}2;2 functions as a water channel in Xenopus laevis oocytes. {VvPIP}1;1 interacts with {VvPIP}2;2 to induce 3-fold higher water permeability. These two aquaporins are colocated in the root from in situ hybridization and immunolocalization of {VvPIP}1 and {VvPIP}2 subfamily members. They occur in root tip, exodermis, root cortex (detected up to 30 mm), and stele. {VvPIP}2;2 {mRNA} does not change diurnally or with water stress, in contrast to {VvPIP}1;1, in which expression reflects the differences in L  o and L  pcell between cultivars in their responses to water stress and rewatering. {VvPIP}1;1 may regulate water transport across roots such that transpirational demand is matched by root water transport capacity. This occurs on a diurnal basis and in response to water stress that corresponds to the difference in drought tolerance between the cultivars.},

However, the actual mechanical properties of the pit membrane are not well known and the exact mode of air-seeding by which cavitation occurs is still uncertain. We examined the relationship between cavitation resistance and bordered pit structure and function in 40 coniferous species. Xylem pressure inducing 50\% loss of hydraulic conductance (P50, a proxy for cavitation resistance) varied widely among species, from -2.9 to -11.3 {MPa}. The valve effect of the pit membrane, measured as a function of margo ﬂexibility and torus overlap, explained more variation in cavitationresistance than simple anatomical traits such as pit membrane, pit aperture or torus size. Highly cavitation resistant species exhibited both a high ﬂexibility of the margo and a large overlap between the torus and the pit aperture, allowing the torus to tightly seal the pit aperture. Our results support the hypothesis of seal capillary-seeding as the most likely mode of air-seeding, and suggest that the adhesion of the torus to the pit border may be the main determinant of cavitation resistance in conifers.},

	abstract = {Sorghum is an important staple food crop in drought prone areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, which is characterized by erratic rainfall with poor distribution. Sorghum is a drought-tolerant crop by nature with reasonable yield compared to other cereal crops, but such abiotic stress adversely affects the productivity. Some sorghum varieties maintain green functional leaves under post-anthesis drought stress referred to as stay-green, which makes it an important crop for food and nutritional security. Notwithstanding, it is difﬁcult to maintain consistency of tolerance over time due to climate change, which is caused by human activities. Drought in sorghum is addressed by several approaches, for instance, breeding drought-tolerant sorghum using conventional and molecular technologies. The challenge with conventional methods is that they depend on phenotyping staygreen, which is complex in sorghum, as it is constituted by multiple genes and environmental effects. Marker assisted selection, which involves the use of {DNA} molecular markers to map {QTL} associated with stay-green, has been useful to supplement stay-green improvement in sorghum. It involves {QTL} mapping associated with the stay-green trait for introgression into the senescent sorghum varieties through marker-assisted backcrossing by comparing with phenotypic ﬁeld data. Therefore, this review discusses mechanisms of drought tolerance in sorghum focusing on physiological, morphological, and biochemical traits. In addition, the review discusses the application of markerassisted selection techniques, including marker-assisted backcrossing, {QTL} mapping, and {QTL} pyramiding for addressing post-ﬂowering drought in sorghum.},

We used {OpenSimRoot}, a functional-structural plant/soil model, to test the hypothesis that larger root cortical cell size ({CCS}), reduced cortical cell file number ({CCFN}), and their interactions with root cortical aerenchyma ({RCA}) and lateral root branching density ({LRBD}) are useful adaptations to suboptimal soil nitrogen availability in maize (Zea mays). Reduced {CCFN} increased shoot dry weight over 80\%. Reduced respiration, reduced nitrogen content, and reduced root diameter accounted for 23\%, 20\%, and 33\% of increased shoot biomass, respectively. Large {CCS} increased shoot biomass by 24\% compared with small {CCS}. When simulated independently, reduced respiration and reduced nutrient content increased the shoot biomass by 14\% and 3\%, respectively. However, increased root diameter resulting from large {CCS} decreased shoot biomass by 4\% due to an increase in root metabolic cost. Under moderate N stress, integrated phenotypes with reduced {CCFN}, large {CCS}, and high {RCA} improved shoot biomass in silt loam and loamy sand soils. In contrast, integrated phenotypes composed of reduced {CCFN}, large {CCS}, and reduced {LRBD} had the greatest growth in silt loam, while phenotypes with reduced {CCFN}, large {CCS}, and high {LRBD} were the best performers in loamy sands. Our results support the hypothesis that larger {CCS}, reduced {CCFN}, and their interactions with {RCA} and {LRBD} could increase nitrogen acquisition by reducing root respiration and root nutrient demand. Phene synergisms may exist between {CCS}, {CCFN}, and {LRBD}. {CCS} and {CCFN} merit consideration for breeding cereal crops with improved nitrogen acquisition, which is critical for global food security.},

	abstract = {Soil compaction is a serious global problem, and is a major cause of inadequate rooting and poor yield in crops around the world. Root system architecture ({RSA}) describes the spatial arrangement of root components within the soil and determines the plant’s exploration of the soil. Soil strength restricts root growth and may slow down root system development. {RSA} plasticity may have an adaptive value, providing environmental tolerance to soil compaction. However, it is challenging to distinguish developmental retardation (apparent plasticity) or responses to severe stress from those root architectural changes that may provide an actual environmental tolerance (adaptive plasticity). In this review, we outline the consequences of soil compaction on the rooting environment and extensively review the various root responses reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss which responses enhance root exploration capabilities in tolerant genotypes, and to what extent these responses might be useful for breeding. We conclude that {RSA} plasticity in response to soil compaction is complex and can be targeted in breeding to increase the performance of crops under specific agronomical conditions.},

	abstract = {We designed a simple dynamic and stochastic architectural model with six parameters to link the foraging performance of root systems to their developmental processes. Soil foraging was quantiﬁed by the volume enveloping the roots until a given uptake distance. Many simulated architectures were obtained by combining four different values for each parameter. The rate of soil colonization was mainly deﬁned by individual root elongation rates and interbranch distances. Less intuitively, we showed that differentiation of elongation rates among the roots increased this colonization rate. Uptake efﬁciency – the ratio of the actual colonized volume to the volume of a unique cylinder with the same length and a radius corresponding to the uptake distance – declined with root system size. Nevertheless, large variations in efﬁciency existed among root systems for a given size, typically in a 4- to 10-fold range. Therefore, the ‘efﬁciency gain’ was deﬁned as the deviation from the average trend in efﬁciency versus size. Between-root differentiation in elongation rates increased this gain. The level of hierarchy between mother and lateral roots, as well as the variation of elongation rates among lateral roots, was also shown to contribute to this optimization. Several parameter combinations could lead to similar efﬁciency gains.},

Root system architecture influences the amount of water important for maintaining crop yield under moisture stress. This study was conducted with the objective of estimating of genetic variability of 214 sorghum genotypes for root and shoot traits during seedling stage. The experiment was conducted at greenhouse of Horticulture and Plant science Department of Jimma University using randomized complete block design. Analysis of variance showed that highly significant difference among the genotypes (P {\textless} 0.01) in all studied traits. Root angle ranged between 14.5◦ (Acc\#23650) and 27.37◦ (Acc\#6723). Root number ranged between 6 and 15, root length between 40 and 72 cm and root to shoot ratio ranged between 0.17 and 0.78. Genotypes from Ethiopian Biodiversity ({IBC}) and {ICRISAT} were showed more root angle genetic variations. Similarly for other root system architecture ({RSA}) traits such as root length, root number and root dry weight, Ethiopian Biodiversity ({IBC}) and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ({ICRISAT}) genotypes showed more genetic diversity than the released varieties. Phenotypic coefficient of variation ({PCV}) was between 29.19\% for leaf area and 13.46\% for root length, and genotypic coefficient variation ({GCV}) was 28.19\% for leaf area and 11.94\% for root angle. Estimates of broad sense heritability were between 40\% for root dry weight and 94.18\% for leaf area. Generally the information generated from this study could help to identified promising genotypes with suitable root traits for potential breeding under specific environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Bioenergy sorghum has high biomass yield potential, drought resilience, good nitrogen use efficiency, and a root system that contributes to the accumulation of soil organic carbon. In this study, field grown bioenergy sorghum root systems were analyzed during the growing season to characterize their depth, biomass, morphology, anatomy, and gene expression profiles. Bioenergy sorghum roots grew continuously during a 155-­day growing season producing {\textasciitilde}175 nodal roots, accumulating {\textasciitilde}7 Mg of dry biomass per hectare, and reaching {\textgreater}2 m deep in the soil profile. Nodal roots within 20 cm of the stem were 1–­5 mm in diameter, whereas roots deeper in soil profiles were enriched in lateral roots with small diameters ({\textasciitilde}30–­500 µm) enabling growth through soil macropores. In older field-­grown plants, roots with intact endodermal, vascular and inner root tissues were surrounded by degraded or aerenchyma-­ filled epidermal and cortical cell layers. Transcriptome analysis of nodal, surface, and deep roots identified {\textgreater}2,500 differentially expressed genes involved in root growth, transport, adaptation, defense, and {AMF}–­root interaction. Deep roots (180–­240 cm) differentially expressed genes that regulate lateral root growth. Surface roots (0–­ 20 cm) located mid-­row differentially expressed genes involved in nitrate transport, whereas ammonium transport genes were expressed in surface and deep roots and genes involved in phosphate transport were expressed in nodal, surface, and deep roots. Overall, bioenergy sorghum's long growing season enables root systems to grow deeper and accumulate more biomass than annual grain crops such as maize, attributes that could help restore annual cropland soil organic carbon levels and improve soil productivity. Deep roots active in nutrient transport are positioned to take-u­ p fertilizer leached deep into soil profiles mitigating potential nutrient run-­off. Bioenergy sorghum's large and deep root system is a key to sustainable production of biofuels, biopower, and bioproducts on annual cropland.},

	abstract = {To better understand the role of root anatomy in regulating plant adaptation to soil mechanical impedance, 12 maize lines were evaluated in two soils with and without compaction treatments under field conditions. Penetrometer resistance was 1–2 {MPa} greater in the surface 30 cm of the compacted plots at a water content of 17–20\% (v/v). Root thickening in response to compaction varied among genotypes and was negatively associated with rooting depth at one field site under non-compacted plots. Thickening was not associated with rooting depth on compacted plots. Genotypic variation in root anatomy was related to rooting depth. Deeper-rooting plants were associated with reduced cortical cell file number in combination with greater mid cortical cell area for node 3 roots. For node 4, roots with increased aerenchyma were deeper roots. A greater influence of anatomy on rooting depth was observed for the thinner root classes. We found no evidence that root thickening is related to deeper rooting in compacted soil; however, anatomical traits are important, especially for thinner root classes.},

	abstract = {The maize root system is crucial for plant establishment as well as water and nutrient uptake. There is substantial genetic and phenotypic variation for root architecture, which gives opportunity for selection. Root traits, however, have not been used as selection criterion mainly due to the difficulty in measuring them, as well as their quantitative mode of inheritance. Seedling root traits offer an opportunity to study multiple individuals and to enable repeated measurements per year as compared to adult root phenotyping. We developed a new software framework to capture various traits from a single image of seedling roots. This framework is based on the mathematical notion of converting images of roots into an equivalent graph. This allows automated querying of multiple traits simply as graph operations. This framework is furthermore extendable to 3D tomography image data. In order to evaluate this tool, a subset of the 384 inbred lines from the Ames panel, for which extensive genotype by sequencing data are available, was investigated. A genome wide association study was applied to this panel for two traits, Total Root Length and Total Surface Area, captured from seedling root images from {WinRhizo} Pro 9.0 and the current framework (called {ARIA}) for comparison using 135,311 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. The trait Total Root Length was found to have significant {SNPs} in similar regions of the genome when analyzed by both programs. This high-throughput trait capture software system allows for large phenotyping experiments and can help to establish relationships between developmental stages between seedling and adult traits in the future.},

	abstract = {Background  Crop breeding based on root system architecture ({RSA}) optimization is an essential factor for improving crop production in developing countries. Identification, evaluation, and selection of root traits of soil-grown crops require innovations that enable high-throughput and accurate quantification of three-dimensional (3D) {RSA} of crops over developmental time.
Results  We proposed an automated imaging system and 3D imaging data processing pipeline to quantify the 3D {RSA} of soil-grown individual plants across seedlings to the mature stage. A multi-view automated imaging system composed of a rotary table and an imaging arm with 12 cameras mounted with a combination of fan-shaped and vertical distribution was developed to obtain 3D image data of roots grown on a customized root support mesh. A 3D imaging data processing pipeline was developed to quantify the 3D {RSA} based on the point cloud generated from multi-view images. The global architecture of root systems can be quantified automatically. Detailed analysis of the reconstructed 3D root model also allowed us to investigate the Spatio-temporal distribution of roots. A method combining horizontal slicing and iterative erosion and dilation was developed to automatically segment different root types, and identify local root traits (e.g., length, diameter of the main root, and length, diameter, initial angle, and the number of nodal roots or lateral roots). One maize (Zea mays L.) cultivar and two rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) cultivars at different growth stages were selected to test the performance of the automated imaging system and 3D imaging data processing pipeline.
Conclusions  The results demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed imaging and analytical system for highthroughput phenotyping of root traits for both monocotyledons and dicotyledons across growth stages. The proposed system offers a potential tool to further explore the 3D {RSA} for improving root traits and agronomic qualities of crops.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work was to describe the relationship between elongation rate and diameter of maize roots and to estimate the length and growth duration of lateral roots of maize. Diameters and elongation rates of roots were measured in situ on plants grown 5 weeks in small rhizotrons under greenhouse conditions. At the end of the experimental period the roots were harvested and diameters of axile and lateral roots were measured. The frequency distribution of diameters of harvested roots was bimodal with a minimum at 0.6 mm; 97\% of axile roots were larger than this value and 98\% of the lateral roots were smaller. Root elongation per day increased as diameter increased but the slope of the relationship with lateral roots was about 2.5 times that with axile roots when separate linear regressions were fitted to the two populations. The length of lateral roots found on axillary roots between the base and about 30 cm from the apex was approximately 2.2 cm. All of the data was consistent with the hypothesis that the lateral roots grew for about 2.5 days and then ceased growing. The axillary roots continued to grow throughout the experimental period at a rate of about 3 cm day -1.},
